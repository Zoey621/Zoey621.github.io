<h1>Zoey Lawrence</h1>
<h2>Hi! It's so wonderful you want to know more about me!</h2>
<p></p>I am a Senior Designer who currently focuses on multimedia products, from newspapers to sports graphics. I love learning about different graphic styles and incorporating them wherever I can. One of my biggest influences is the different grunge and punk styles, more specifically Jamie Reid. 

Being part of student news is something I take extreme pride in and want to showcase anytime I'm given the chance. Having an opportunity to elevate people's stories with the power of design is something I wouldn't trade for the world. 
Currently, I am a double Major in Graphic Design BFA & Animation BAA, with a minor in Religion (Art History focus). </p>
